			<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px; color:#111111">True story: once upon a time, Liu Bei (Emperor of Shu) and Sun Quan (Emperor of Wu) formed an ally against Cao Cao (Emperor of Wei, who had the strongest military forces at that time). However, Liu and Sun kept arguing over the ownership of Jingzhou, a state on the boundary of their countries with great strategic significance, as Liu Bei managed to “borrow” Jingzhou (in fact, only part of it), promising to return the state to Wu once he finished his expansion to the western territories. The problem is, as Shu and Wu were not as strong as Wei, Liu and Sun had to form a coalition against Cao, otherwise neither of them was capable of fighting against Cao. On the other hand, Sun wants to take back Jingzhou before it becomes impossible to do so (as Liu’s power at Jingzhou was stabilizing). It happened that Sun was too impulsive to hold the ally and attacked Jingzhou in 219 AD. It seems that their chain of mutual distrust had inevitably ruled out the possibility of cooperation, abandoning the potential mutual benefit (of making an ally). Similar examples abound in modern society; it is natural to wonder what the underlying reason is for people to sacrifice mutual benefit for marginal interest based on distrust. If you’re familiar with game theory, you should’ve guessed there’s a game-theoretical explanation. To unveil the secret behind this, let’s play a game:

			<p style="color: #111111; font-size: 25px; text-align:center">
				We have learned in class about Nash Equilibrium as a solution concept of two-person nonzero-sum games. A natural extension of Nash Equilibrium in the case of dynamic games is the subgame perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE). A subgame of a dynamic game, stated informally,
				is the continuation of a game at any node in the game’s extensive form satisfying certain properties . A strategy profile (that is, a strategy combination at every step of the game) is a SPNE if it represents a Nash Equilibrium of every subgame of the original game. 
				Intuitively, an SPNE is a strategy profile that is optimal (in the Nash sense) at any point in the game, regardless of what happened in the past. <hr>

				To find a SPNE, a common method is called backward induction, which is a procedure where one first finds the optimal last move, and the other player chooses their optimal strategies accordingly. Continuing the process until the beginning of the game, one then obtains a SPNE of the game. 
				Remark: every SPNE must also be a Nash Equilibrium of the game, so the former is actually a stronger solution concept.
